# Overlay Namespaces

## Concept

* real names of people don't need to be globally distinct, why must internet names be so?
* IRC: nobody "owns" channel or nick names
* "awesome lists"
* curated lists of stateofthedapps, etc
* dns: /etc/hosts, private domains, pi-hole name blocking
* del.icio.us, https://pinboard.in/search/
* tags
